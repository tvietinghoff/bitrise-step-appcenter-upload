  AppCenter apk + mapping upload
summary: |
  Upload APK + mapping file to Microsoft AppCenter
description: |
  This step uploads APK + mapping.txt to AppCenter using official CLI.
  The step is relevant only for Android projects.

  NB: mapping file upload is currently not supported by AppCenter and therefore has been commented out in the
  script. Watch this issue to raise the priority on AppCenter fixing this:
  https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-cli/issues/551

  By default $BITRISE_APK_PATH + $BITRISE_MAPPING_PATH env are used to lookup for APK and mapping file.

  It is important to [obtain API Token from AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms/settings/apitokens)
  to use this step.
